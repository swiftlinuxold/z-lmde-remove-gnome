NOTES ON REMOVING GNOME

Comparing the package list of LMDE with GNOME with the package list of LMDE with Xfce may help.
Packages included in the GNOME version but not the Xfce version are ones to consider cutting.

To get the list of installed packages, the command is "dpkg --get-selections>selections.txt".

There should be a way to automate the process of comparing the two package lists.
