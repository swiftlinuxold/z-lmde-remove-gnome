NOTES ON REMOVING GNOME

Comparing the package list of LMDE with GNOME with the package list of LMDE with Xfce may help.
Packages included in the GNOME version but not the Xfce version are ones to consider cutting.

To get the list of installed packages, the command is "dpkg --get-selections>selections.txt".

There should be a way to automate the process of comparing the two package lists.


UPDATE:
Package lists for LDME with GNOME and LMDE with XFCE have been pulled from their respective locations and are currently
being compared to determine the most significant differences regarding packages. A comparison will be provided for 
referencing purposes. The best way to automoate package comparison will be provided as well. The diff tool will probably
be the best option.
